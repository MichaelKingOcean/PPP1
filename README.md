# Testing

Tetsed using Google Chrome. Tested different device and screen resolutions and inspeted with GOogle DevTools.

Most of the problem faced come when its time to ajust the section and also the Menu and BookNow links on the Hero Image. Also when using the small screen size the hero image content goes out of frame.
